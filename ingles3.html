    RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED
    <br>
    The good old Golden Rule says it all: empathy, tolerance and peace. This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. It spans cultures and faiths and is a universal age old concept which can’t fail!.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: I treated my teammates with respect.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: I am have treated them with respect.
<br><br>


RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY, NOT TO SPEAK
<br>
Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be established if people are unable to communicate with others; to listen to their experiences and views and show empathy, understanding and compassion.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: We listened to the teacher in class.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: We have listened to the teacher in class.
<br><br>


RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
<br>
We all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things. Building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important. Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of expression other than our own.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: He teacher is has respected the student's opinion.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: He respected his partner's opinion.
<br><br>


RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE 
<br>
Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cycle. This does not change anything.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: We have fixed our problems.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: They fixed their problems.
<br><br>


RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID 
<br>
Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people according to an us vs. them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive and unproductive.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: You have accepted John identity.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: He accepted the identity of his partner.
<br><br>


RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES 
<br>
Take people for the individuals they are. Avoid misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get to know a person instead. This will avoid offence, misunderstandings and ultimately help you to create a real bond with others based on true understanding, empathy and trust. After all, no one likes to be judged – especially from the outsid.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO:Juan has created a bond of trust with his partner Luis.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: Juan created a bond of trust with his partner Luis.
<br><br>


RULE #7: APPROACH THE MEDIA WITH SKEPTICISM
<br>
Don’t just believe everything you see on the TV, in the newspapers or on the internet. Think objectively for yourself. Get to know the people and facts behind any story and don’t fall for media scapegoating. Stand united.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: Luis believed something they said on the news.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: Luis believed something I said in the newspaper.
<br><br>


RULE #8: BE CAREFUL OF THE LANGUAGE YOU USE
<br>
Your choice of language, alongside tone of voice and intonation all convey a message. Make sure that that message is positive. Be mindful of the language you use, avoiding anything with misogynistic, racist, Islamophobic, homophobic or anti-Semitic overtones. Do not underestimate the power of language – for better or for worse! And remember, it’s not always what you say, it’s how you say it.
<br>
-.PRESENTE PERFECTO: They have avoided saying an inappropriate word.
<br>
-.PASADO SIMPLE: He avoided saying an inappropriate word.
